# Summary
Sudokdo, which could also be called Puzzler, is a mobile app that allows you to play games of sudoku. What makes it different than similar apps on the market is the fact that it will be able keep track of how many games each user has completed in a row. The problems with most of the Sudoku apps on the market today are mostly attributed to poor user interfaces and a feeling of monotony that pushes users away rather than pull them in. These drawbacks will not be present in Sudokdo because the puzzles will be presented in a cleaner way than other apps and upon completion will add to the users "score" or number of games completed in a row.
